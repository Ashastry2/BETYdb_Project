Biofuel Ecophysiological Traits and Yields Database
This interface will provide an updated traits information for species from TRY database. Trait information from TRY database gets updated regularly. In order to provide the updated trait information from TRYdb in the form of BETYdb, we have developed this interface. You can query information pertaining to a certain species or trait. We acquire the data from the TRY database, modify the data to fit the schema for BETYdb and connect the information between the two databases. Visualization options are available through this interface
